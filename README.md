# MUD-2
M.U.D. (Multi-User Dungeon) is a turn-based dungeon crawler where the user navigates through and loots rooms within a map/dungeon while fighting enemies along the way. 
The user can equip or use various items found either from looting rooms or enemies bodies. Some items are equippable weapons or pieces of armor. All items have a gold value. 
Rooms of the map can be decorated with different entities or objects including enemies to fight, chests to loot, along with traps and obstacles.
